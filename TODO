Todo
====

- Get PDO working for reading data (joint angles) from the EPOS controllers
- Clearly define a split between the library and test programs
    - Define routines for setting up nodes in profile position mode (keep in mind that maybe not all nodes will be setup in the same mode)

- Create Python bindings
- Create ROS node that exposes the functionality of the library
